    <h1>Easy mochi</h1>
    <img src="images/eazy-mochi.jpg" alt="Eazy Mochi">
    <p>Mochi is a bun-shaped Japanese dessert made from sweet glutinous rice flour,</p>
    <p>or mochigome. It has a soft, chewy texture that is somewhat elastic.</p>
    <p>is often flavored with matcha (or green tea powder), which gives it a light green hue.</p>
     <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 cup sweetened red bean paste</li>
        <li> 1 cup glutinous rice flour</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon green tea powder (matcha)</li>
        <li> 1 cup water</li>
        <li> ¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li> ½ cup cornstarch, for rolling out the dough</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li> Wrap red bean paste in aluminum foil and place in the freezer until solid, at least 1 hour.</li>
        <li> Mix glutinous rice flour and green tea powder thoroughly in a microwave-safe bowl. Stir in water, then sugar; mix until smooth.</li>
        <li> Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and microwave for 3 minutes 30 seconds.</li>
        <li> Meanwhile, remove red bean paste from the freezer and divide into 8 equal balls. Set aside.</li>
        <li> Remove rice flour mixture from the microwave. Stir and heat, covered, for another 15 to 30 seconds.</li>
        <li><p> a work surface with cornstarch. Roll about 2 tablespoons of hot rice flour mixture into a ball </p> 
            <p> the ball and place one ball of frozen red bean paste in the center. Pinch and press </p> 
            <p> dough around the bean paste until completely covered. Sprinkle with additional cornstarch and place mochi,</p>
            <p> seam-side down, in a paper muffin liner to prevent sticking. </p></li>
        <li>Repeat Step 6 to make remaining mochi.</li>
    </ol>
